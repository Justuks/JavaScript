# Testing

### During development phase, project and its features performance were constantly checked
### using 'Developer Tools'.
### 'Developer Tools' and its 'Box Model' together with 'Different Device Emulation'
### were very useful in configurating project responsiveness to smaller screen sizes.
### Besides Developer Tools, kinetic tests were carried out in order to make sure that every link regardless of its location is responding. 
  
# Hardware and virtual 'test beds'  

### Apart from testing website reactions to different screen sizes on 'DevTools' and
### ['am I responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) website, responsiveness was also ###crosschecked on physical devices such as HP PAVILION laptop, Samsung Z Flip and Motorola G9 Play mobile phones.
### No issues were found and everything worked as intended.  

# W3C CSS Validation

### Checking CSS code proved that it has no errors.

# Deployment

## Project was developed using GitPod as a building platform.
## The website was deployed using GitHub Pages by following these steps:
* In the GitHub repository navigate to the Settings tab
* On the left hand menu select Pages
* For the source select Branch: main
* After the webpage refreshes automaticaly you will se a ribbon on the top saying: "Your site is published at:  https://justuks.github.io/JavaScript/

# Problems Encountered
### During the stage of development I made a mistake and did not check my buttons contrast.
### I calibrated their background color initially as rgb(168, 123, 50) with smoke white text.
### I was drawn into sin, thinking that the contrast will be sufficient, however, during readme.md
### writing process I found out that it was a mistake with very little time to correct it within readme file.
## Conclusion: Lesson learned the hard way. Will make sure in the future to check contrasts beforehand.

# Acknowledgement
## This project would not have been achieved without the help and guidance of
### my mentor Mr. Mohammad Shami, and also without helpful hand of:
### Slack Community
### Code Institute tutors
### And various online recources, such as: W3C
### and: Developer Mozilla
## But the person who deserves a particular recognition is my wife, who demonstrated an immense patience and support.
